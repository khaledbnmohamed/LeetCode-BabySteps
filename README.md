## How to know it's a sliding window question ?

The Sliding window is a problem-solving technique for problems that involve arrays/lists. These problems are easy to solve using a brute force approach in O(n^2) or O(n^3). Using the 'sliding window' technique, we can reduce the time complexity to O(n).

Great article on this is here: https://medium.com/outco/how-to-solve-sliding-window-problems-28d67601a66

So the first thing you want to be able to do is to identify a problem that uses a sliding window paradigm. Luckily, there are some common giveaways:

The problem will involve a data structure that is ordered and iterable like an array or a string

You are looking for some subrange in that array/string, like the longest, shortest or target value.

There is an apparent naive or brute force solution that runs in O(NÂ²), O(2^N) or some other large time complexity.

*But the biggest giveaway is that the thing you are looking for is often some kind of optimal, like the longest sequence or shortest sequence of something that satisfies a given condition exactly.*
